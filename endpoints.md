# Functions and Endpoints

## Functions
- ### Home
  - Shows all activities from friends, recommended challenges, targets, and weekly stats
- ### RTS AI
  - Recommended workout for the day
  - Daily Brefing: can send notification every day at certain time too
    - The weather today, what time you should run at, what to eat, route for the day, workout for the day, and feedback/input on what you want to do
    - IF YOU HAVE A TRAINING PLAN:
      - What todays run will be, what time you should do it at, what to wear (run wear)
  - Find me routes for this workout (RTS Pathfunder)
    - Maps, routes, workout so that GAP=Target pace
  - Run wear - gives you clothes to use during runs that allow mobility but keep you warm/cool
  - **Training Plans**
    - 
    - **Start**
      - 400, 800, 1600, 3k, 3200, 5k, 10k, Half-Marathon, Marathon, Custom
      - Give goal for distance
      - Give fastest mile
        - If you dont have a mile time yet, it will instruct you to go out and run one
      - Give weeks until
      - It will then calculate if you have enough time to do it.
        - CALC: D = distance(miles), G = goal time for race(minutes), T = fastest mile time(minutes per mile), W = training duration(weeks), F = improvement factor(rate of weekly progress)
        - CONVERT min/mi with this: 
          - seconds --> decimal: $\frac{seconds}{60}$ aka: (seconds/60)
          - decimal --> seconds: decimal * 60
        - **STEPS:**
          - 
          - 1. Calculate Target page (TP)
            - TP = $\frac{g}{d}$ also shown as: (G/D) goal time for race/distance
              - Results in required pace in minutes per mile
          - 2. Calculate Improvement needed (I)
            - I = T - TP 
            - This calculates the difference between fastest mile and target pace
          - 3. Estimate training duration
            - IF I > 0:
              - W = $\frac{\log\left(\frac{T}{\text{TP}}\right)}{\log(1 + F)}$
              - Finds estimated weeks with F as training factor (estimated 2% per week)
            - IF I â‰¤ 0:
              - W = Min. conditioning period
              - Approx. 8-12 weeks
    - **View Current Stats**
      - 
      - See what you are doing today
      - Veiw calender (if everything goes according to plan, this will work)
        - Can change calender and runs based on sleep, food, hydration, etc.
      - See how everyhting thats going on in your life affects this training plan
      - Weeks left, estimated pace (based on fitness) compared to goal pace
- **Injury Prevention and Nutrition**
  - 
  - Log for injuries
  - AI runs stretching routines that fix all problems that you say your pain is
  - Fuel for after runs
  - Daily fuel and what to eat
  - How sleep, hydration, and food you have eaten has affected your runs, what to do better
- **Charts and analytics**
  - 
  - Fitness, fatigue, training readiness, and acute training load.
  - Calculation Steps: Power &rarr; HR Zone &rarr; Relative Effort &rarr; Fitness for Today &rarr; Acute Training Load &rarr; Training Readiness
  - Power (Watts)
  - Wattage Output (inputs include: elevation gradient, pace, cadence, stride length):
    - $P_\text{Total} = (E_\text{run} \cdot M \cdot V) + (M \cdot G \cdot H_\text{osc} \cdot F) + (\frac{1}{2} \cdot P \cdot A_{frontal} \cdot C_\text{d} \cdot v^3) + (M \cdot G \cdot v \cdot \sin(\theta))$
    - **BREAKDOWN:**
      - 
      - $\text{Horizontal power}$ $(E_\text{run} \cdot M \cdot V)$
        - $E_\text{run}$ is the energy cost per unit distance per mass $\text{J/kg/m}$
        - Typical value is $\text{1.036J/kg/m}$ (equivalent to $\text{~1 kcal/kg/m}$)
        - $M$ is runner mass (in $kg$)
        - $V$ is velocity $(m/s)$
          - $V$ is the time of one mile in seconds
          - $V$ = $1609/360 = 4.47 \text{ m/s (6 minute mile)}$
            - $360$ seconds is a $\text{6 minute mile}$
      - $\text{Vertical Power Component}$ $(M \cdot G \cdot H_\text{osc} \cdot F)$
        - $M$ is the runner mass in $kg$
        - $G$ is the acceleration due to gravity $(9.81 \text{ }m/s^2)$
        - $H_\text{osc}$ is vertical oscillation per stride $(meters)$
          - Typically $0.05-0.12$ $m$
          - Measured using wearables like GPS watches
        - $F$ is cadence (or steps per second)
          - $\text{F} = \frac{v \cdot k}{\text{stride length}}$
          - Where $k=2$ (account for both legs)
          - Stride length can be estimated as height $(meters) \cdot 1.14$
          - Example for a runner who is $1.75$ meters tall, running at $4.47$ $m/s$: (and stride length is $1.995$)
          - $F = \frac{4.47 \cdot 2}{1.995} = 4.48 \text{ steps/sec (~268 steps/min)}$
        - Air resistance power component $(\frac{1}{2} \cdot P \cdot A_\text{frontal} \cdot C_d \cdot v^3)$
          - $P$ is air density ($1.225\text{ }kg/m^3$ at sea level)
        - $A_\text{frontal}$ is the $frontal$ area of the runner (in square meters)
          - Typical value is $~0.5m^2$
        - $C_d$ is coefficient drag (unitless)
          - ~1.0 typical for runners wearing tight clothing
        - $V^3$ is the velocity term raised to the third power ($m/s^3$)
          - Already calculated in the horizontal power component
        - Incline/Decline power component $(M \cdot G \cdot V \cdot \sin(\theta))$
          - $M$ is the runner mass in kg
          - $G$ is the acceleration due to gravity
          - $V$ is the runner's velocity in meters per second
          - $\sin(\theta)$ is the sine of the inclination angle $\theta$.
            - For a given gradient $(\text{\% slope})$: $\sin(\theta)$ $=$ $gradient$ $\frac{\%}{100}$
            - $5\%$ incline would be $\sin(\theta)$ = $\frac{5}{100}$ $=$ $0.05$

  - **Relative Effort**
    - 
    - $\text{RE} = {\frac{\text{P} \cdot \text{D}}{W} \cdot \frac{1}{t} + \left(1 + \frac{\text{Elevation gain}}{D}\right) \cdot \text{HR Average}}$
      - P = Power in watts (see above)
      - W = weight in kg
      - D = Distance in km
      - T = time (seconds)
      - $\text{1}+\frac{\text{elevation gain}}{D}$ = adjustment for terrain gradients
      - HRavg = Average HR (% of maximum)

  - **Fitness**
    - 
    - **$ATL$ MEANS FATIGUE, $CTL$ MEANS FITNESS**
      - $ATL$: Acute Training Load (Fatigue, Training Load)
      - $CTL$: Chronic Training Load (Fitness)
    - Long term fitness
    - Calculated on a scale from 1-200
    - RUN THROUGH EVERY RUN WHEN NEW IS ADDED (42 DAYS)
    - $\text{CTL} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}{\left(\text{RE Activity}_{i} \cdot e^{-\frac{\Delta t_i}{T_{fit}}} \right)}$
      - $CTL$ = fitness
      - $\text{RE Activity}_\text{i}$ is the relative effort (RE Activity) of the  day $i$ workout.
      - $\Delta t_i$ is the number of days since the $i$-th workout was performed. (Example: If it was 2 days ago, it would be $-\frac{2}{42}$)
      - $T_{fit}$ is the time constant for fitness (e.g., 42 days).
      - $\sum_{i=1}^{N}$ Where $N$ = Number of days that activities that have been completed (e.g., if you have done runs for 5 days N = 5) and where $i$ is the indexing day (e.g., $i$ is 1, so RE Activty of day 1, changes to 2 next itteration, so $i$ of RE Activity of day 2 and so on)
  - **Exponential Weighting for recent fatigue**
    - 
    - RUN THROUGH EVERY RUN WHEN NEW IS ADDED (7 DAYS)
    - $\text{ATL} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\text{RE Activity}_{i} \cdot e^ {-\frac{\Delta t_i}{T_{fat}}} \right)}}{\text{Time Period}}$
      - $\text{ATL}$ = fatigue
      - ${T_{fat}}$ = Time constant for fatigue (7 days)
      - Works the same as $CTL$ (Look above)
      - $\text{Time Period}$ = Whatever is specified. 7 days for week, 1 day for recent activities, and 14-30 days for 2 weeks, month, etc
  - **Fitness relative to Fatigue**
    - 
    - CALCULATE WHEN CTL AND ATL ARE UPDATED
    - $\text{Form (TSB)} = CTL - ATL$
      - Positive TSB means well rested and ready to preform
      - Negative TSB means fatigue is grater than fitness and could mean injury or strain (need rest to prevent injury)
  - **Min and Max formulas**
    - 
    - **CTL**
      - $\frac{\text{CTL} - CTL_\text{min}}{ CTL_\text{max} - CTL_\text{min}} \cdot 100$
      - $CTL_\text{min}$ = 0
      - $CTL_\text{max}$ = 200
      - $CTL$ = Current
    - **ATL**
      - $\frac{\text{ATL} - ATL_\text{min}}{ ATL_\text{max} - ATL_\text{min} } \cdot 100$
      - $ATL_\text{min}$ = 0
      - $ATL_\text{max}$ = 100
      - $ATL$ = Current
